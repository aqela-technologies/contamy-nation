                    Kiora is the wonderful artist we had the pleasure to work with. She is
                    always full of creative and ground-breaking ideas, and her enthusiasm
                    for our project is immeasurable. If you like the design of our
                    Contamy-nation sea critters, be sure to check out her Instagram page,
                    and support her on Patreon, because this is just the tip of the
                    iceberg - she is working on many, many more interesting projects!
